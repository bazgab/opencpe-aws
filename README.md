# OpenCPE - Open Cloud Policy Executor
**_IMPORTANT_: Work in Progress - not ready for usage**
### Overview

OpenCPE aims to be an all-in-one solution for Cloud resource control with heavily opinionated defaults, focusing on ease of use and maintenance. While other tools offer flexibility by requiring users to write their own policies and requiring different plugins to provide specific functionalities (logging, mailing, account management), OpenCPE provides sensible default policies out-of-the-box and has no additional plugins required to have full-control of the tool's actions.
